# Roadmap Status — crypto-swing-bot

> **Single source of truth for "where are we / what's next."** A new session should read this
> file first for any platform-roadmap work, then jump to the **NEXT ACTION** below.
> Keep this file updated at the end of every work session (it is the cross-session memory anchor).

## ▶ NEXT ACTION

**Sub-project D is ✅ DONE.** All sub-projects (A → B1 → B2 → C → D) complete.

The platform roadmap is fully delivered. Next session can either:
1. **Run the selftest CLI** against the live container: `python -m swingbot.selftest --no-llm` (smoke run)
2. **Schedule the selftest** via `/schedule` for nightly execution
3. **Start a new sub-project** — brainstorm the next improvement area

**Housekeeping:** Sub-projects A, B1, B2, C are committed **and pushed to `origin/master`**.
Sub-project D is committed locally (master) — **push when ready** (`git push origin master`).
The brain's default `brain_ollama_url` (`localhost:11434`) does not work inside Docker — use
`http://172.17.0.1:11434` (already set on running instance). See `docs/SUBPROJECT_C_FINDINGS.md`.

## How to resume (mechanics)

1. **Read this file → NEXT ACTION.**
2. **Check memory:** `MEMORY.md` (auto-loaded) lists per-topic memory files; read the ones the NEXT ACTION touches.
   Key files: `platform-improvement-roadmap`, `subproject-a-ui-cleanup-status`, `archive-data-source-findings`.
3. **If NEXT ACTION points to an existing plan** (a `*.md` in `docs/superpowers/plans/`):
   the work is task-by-task with `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checkboxes. Find the first unchecked task and continue from there:
   ```bash
   grep -n "^- \[ \] \*\*Step" docs/superpowers/plans/<the-plan>.md | head -1   # first unfinished step
   grep -nE "^## Task|✅ DONE" docs/superpowers/plans/<the-plan>.md              # per-task status
   ```
   Then load `superpowers:executing-plans` and continue. Tick checkboxes + commit as you finish each task.
4. **If NEXT ACTION is "write a spec"**: load `superpowers:brainstorming` (design first), then `superpowers:writing-plans`.
5. **Before claiming done:** run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` (expect `288 passed, 5 skipped` as of 2026-06-03),
   and for UI work `cd frontend && npm run build`.

## Environment notes (carry forward)

- Python venv: **`.venv/bin/python`** (plain `python`/`pytest` are not on PATH).
- graphify CLI is **`python3 -m graphify`** (not on PATH); run `python3 -m graphify update .` after code changes.
- `~/.swingbot/candles.db` is **read-only in the sandbox** — for backfills point `SWINGBOT_DATA_DIR=/tmp/...`.
- The app runs in Docker (`crypto-swing-bot-swingbot-1` on :8000). Rebuild/restart = `docker compose build swingbot && docker compose up -d swingbot`; this **interrupts the live paper-trading bot**, so get user consent.
- Working on `master` is user-approved for this project; scope each `git add` to your task's files (the tree carries unrelated uncommitted FVG/presets/graphify work that must stay untouched).
