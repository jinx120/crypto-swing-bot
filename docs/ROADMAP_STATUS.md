## ▶ NEXT ACTION

**Visible Autonomous Entry — Phase 2 (persisted desire + paper auto-resume) is DONE (2026-06-13).**
Plan `plans/2026-06-13-visible-autonomous-entry-phase-2.md` executed end-to-end; all 6 tasks
committed on `master`. Full suite **412 passed, 6 skipped**; frontend builds; container rebuilt +
restarted clean. **Live acceptance verified on `:8000`:** pressing Start persists
`running_desired=true`; a full `docker compose build && up -d` with **no** Start press auto-resumed
the paper loop (`running_actual: true`, `startup_error: null`) — **success criterion 1**; an
explicit Stop then `restart` stayed stopped (`running_desired: false`, `running_actual: false`) —
**success criterion 2**. Bot left running + desired so future rebuilds auto-resume.

What shipped: new `RuntimeStateStore` (SQLite, persists only `running_desired`, defaults false — no
silent opt-in); supervisor gains `running_desired` property, `mark_desired()`, `startup_error`, and
`auto_start_if_desired()` (paper-only, failure-tolerant, never raises); `POST /api/control/start`
marks desire true only after a successful start, `POST /api/control/stop` marks false before
stopping, `halt`/`pause`/`resume`/shutdown never touch desire; new `GET /api/control/lifecycle`;
FastAPI lifespan calls `auto_start_if_desired()` after the poller and tolerates its failure;
`webmain` wires the store into the supervisor.

**Phase 2 review corrections integrated (2026-06-14):** applied the code-review-revised plan's
hardening to `master`. `RuntimeStateStore` now guards its shared `check_same_thread=False`
connection with an `RLock`. The supervisor gained serialized `request_start()` / `request_stop()`
that hold `_lifecycle_lock` across both the loop transition and desire persistence (so a concurrent
Stop can't be overwritten by an in-flight earlier Start, and an explicit Stop never auto-resumes on
restart); a successful explicit Start clears any stale `startup_error`; `auto_start_if_desired()` now
runs under `_lifecycle_lock` and captures runtime-state read failures. `POST /api/control/start|stop`
route through these serialized methods (with `hasattr` fallbacks for fakes). Suite **420 passed,
6 skipped**; ruff clean; frontend builds; container rebuilt + live-verified on `:8000`
(`running_actual:true`, `running_desired:true`, `startup_error:null`). +20 tests over the prior 412
(new concurrency/request-ordering coverage).

**NEXT: write the Phase 3 plan** — durable cycle/decision telemetry, order/pending/fill state with
broker-confirmed positions, persistent trades, and the three `/api/health/*` contracts (spec §5
Phase 3). Spec basis: `specs/2026-06-13-visible-autonomous-entry-design-reviewed.md`.

**Sub-project E is DONE and live-verified** (full gate green, 6/6 usage sessions pass, 0 drift;
Health tab confirmed live). The platform roadmap A→E is complete. Suggested next steps:

1. ~~Schedule the nightly usage-agent run~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-13).** A **system cron job**
   runs `scripts/nightly-selftest.sh` daily at **03:00 local** (`crontab -l` to view; logs to
   `~/.swingbot/selftest-cron.log`). It drives all six sessions, reconciles against the
   Guide/specs, and files new drift into the Brain inbox. Runs `--no-llm` (deterministic gate +
   sessions + drift, no Ollama dependency); drop that flag in the wrapper to also get LLM
   improvement proposals. NB: `/schedule` (cloud routines) was **not** used — cloud agents can't
   reach the local `:8000` container; this is a local cron job by design.
2. **Triage drift on the Health tab** (`http://localhost:8000/#/health`) whenever a run goes
   non-green or files findings: each `doc_fix`/`ui_fix` card is recommend-only — fix manually,
   then Dismiss.
3. **All work is pushed** — A–E are all committed **and pushed to `origin/master`** (B2, D, E
   pushed 2026-06-13, commit `e0229fb`).

**Housekeeping:** The brain's default `brain_ollama_url` (`localhost:11434`) does not work inside
Docker — use `http://172.17.0.1:11434` (already set on running instance). See
`docs/SUBPROJECT_C_FINDINGS.md`. The selftest/usage-agent now writes proposals to
`brain_proposals.json` (the file the UI reads); artifacts live under `~/.swingbot/agent/`.

## How to resume (mechanics)

1. **Read this file → NEXT ACTION.**
2. **Check memory:** `MEMORY.md` (auto-loaded) lists per-topic memory files; read the ones the NEXT ACTION touches.
   Key files: `platform-improvement-roadmap`, `subproject-a-ui-cleanup-status`, `archive-data-source-findings`.
3. **If NEXT ACTION points to an existing plan** (a `*.md` in `docs/superpowers/plans/`):
   the work is task-by-task with `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checkboxes. Find the first unchecked task and continue from there:
   ```bash
   grep -n "^- \[ \] \*\*Step" docs/superpowers/plans/<the-plan>.md | head -1   # first unfinished step
   grep -nE "^## Task|✅ DONE" docs/superpowers/plans/<the-plan>.md              # per-task status
   ```
   Then load `superpowers:executing-plans` and continue. Tick checkboxes + commit as you finish each task.
4. **If NEXT ACTION is "write a spec"**: load `superpowers:brainstorming` (design first), then `superpowers:writing-plans`.
5. **Before claiming done:** run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` (expect `288 passed, 5 skipped` as of 2026-06-03),
   and for UI work `cd frontend && npm run build`.

## Environment notes (carry forward)

- Python venv: **`.venv/bin/python`** (plain `python`/`pytest` are not on PATH).
- graphify CLI is **`python3 -m graphify`** (not on PATH); run `python3 -m graphify update .` after code changes.
- `~/.swingbot/candles.db` is **read-only in the sandbox** — for backfills point `SWINGBOT_DATA_DIR=/tmp/...`.
- The app runs in Docker (`crypto-swing-bot-swingbot-1` on :8000). Rebuild/restart = `docker compose build swingbot && docker compose up -d swingbot`; this **interrupts the live paper-trading bot**, so get user consent.
- Working on `master` is user-approved for this project; scope each `git add` to your task's files (the tree carries unrelated uncommitted FVG/presets/graphify work that must stay untouched).
